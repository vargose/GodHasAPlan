# A responsive Bible Web App

Here is my [Trello Kanban Board](https://trello.com/b/4Ulkd4Zc/god-has-a-plan-web-app)

Started with [Angular Seed Template](https://github.com/angular/angular-seed)
Using [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) for a responsive UI

Using Karma for Unit Tests and Protractor for end to end tests

I intend on using this [Bible database](https://github.com/scrollmapper/bible_databases) 
loaded into [Solr](http://lucene.apache.org/solr/)
